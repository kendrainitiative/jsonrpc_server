Provides a JSON-RPC 1.1 and 2.0 server implementation for the [Services module](http://drupal.org/project/services).
This module is being developed [over at GitHub](http://github.com/hugowetterberg/jsonrpc_server/tree/master) but is mirrored to the Drupal CVS. You are very welcome to contribute with patches, or even better, get a account at GitHub and fork it!
Development sponsored by [Good Old](http://goodold.se).
